*This holiday season DC Inno published [a wish list](http://dcinno.streetwise.co/2015/12/24/dc-tech-startup-wishlist-2016/) of things it'd like to see happen with the DC tech community in 2016. I thought it would be interesting to publish a similar post, from a younger (and perhaps more inexperienced?) perspective.*

#### Introduction 

A bit of background to understand where I'm coming from. I'm currently a sophomore at Harvard studying computer science. Born and bred in Northern Virginia, I've worked at both a startup ([PrepFactory](https://www.prepfactory.com/)) and large tech company ([LivingSocial](https://www.livingsocial.com/)) in the capital. I also started my own non-profit ([DCXP](https://www.joindcxp.org)) in the area to cultivate talented high school and college students, an attempt to strengthen DC's tech community from the ground up. 

Through my various work experiences and time networking with entrepreneurs, VCs, and angel investors through DCXP, I've left with mixed feelings. On one hand, I feel a deep sense of **pride and belonging**. It's inspiring to see life-changing innovation and companies changing the world steps away from where I grew up. And for that I am extremely grateful. On the other hand, I see a lot of room for improvement. I think the DC, Maryland, and Virginia (DMV) has a lot to offer and is poised to really develop rapidly in the coming years. In the years to follow, I want to see more talented individuals set-up shop in the area and to build great companies, create new jobs, and foster a stronger tech community in what is already a very substantial one. 

Based on my experience, here are a few things I believe would help the area further progress in 2016.

#### More seed funding in DC, Maryland, and Virginia.

This is pretty self-explanatory and is the same thought echoed by DC Inno's article. More seed money means more early-stage companies. And more early-stage companies means more talent and interest drawn to the area. 

- I think the rise of incubators and co-working spaces in the area is a push in the right direction. See 1776 for DC, and ___ incubators in the DC area
