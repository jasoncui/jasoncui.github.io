title: Working with HelloToken
---

Last week, I  was brought on board [HelloToken](http://www.hellotoken.com) as a part of the business development team. For now I'll be working with them for the rest of the semester but, if things go well, I'll continue throughout the rest of the term. And hopefully they do! 

## What exactly does [HelloToken](http://www.hellotoken.com) do?

Essentially, HelloToken is a product that enables publishers to earn exponentially more per visitor than ads and paywalls through a one-click question that serves as a micropayment. As daily consumers of content, nothing is more distracting and unaesthetic than intrusive advertisements or blurred out paywalls.

HelloToken can replace all obtrusive advertisements on a site with a clean, one-click question that when answered will give immediate access to that page's content. Researchers and companies will pay to ask questions relevant to them - for instance, a startup might be interested in "preference testing" which one of their new logo designs is more appealing. These questions can then be sent off to the proper target audience, whether it be a technology or political blog.

Publishers and bloggers can then use these questions as a form of monetization. By integrating HelloToken into their sites, publishers can be paid for each question answered by visitors to the sites. 

## Okay, but why does content monetization need improvement?
