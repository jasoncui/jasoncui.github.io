First a bit of personal context. I first fell in love with training while in high school. With my sophomore and junior years packed and focused on academics and extracurricular work, I didn't have much time to workout, let alone buy a gym membership and go regularly. Instead I resorted to quick workouts at night after getting back home from school. This ranged from running a few miles around my neighborhood to performing sets of burpees and calisthenics in my basement. 

I didn't lift a single weight or adhere to any sort of plan; instead, I valued the feelings of satisfaction and accomplishment each workout gave me. Sweat and exertion were converted into much needed endorphins, distracting me from a difficult test or upcoming deadline. 

It wasn't until the summer before my freshman year of college that I got my first gym membership. I was by no means an expert (or have any experience at all for that matter), but I came in with enthusiasm. I fell in love with the progression and consistency. 


At present day, my love for the gym has grown, matured. I am by no means an expert or even accomplished bodybuilder or powerlifter, but without a doubt working out has become one of my passions.
