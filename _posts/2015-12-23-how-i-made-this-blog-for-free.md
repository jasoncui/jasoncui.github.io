*I've had a lot of people ask me how I made this blog. Completely for free. Below I outline some of the steps I took. Hopefully this will serve as a helpful resource to those looking to start a personal site or blog of their own.* 

As I mention in the [about section]({{ site.url }}/about), this site was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) and is hosted (for free) with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
