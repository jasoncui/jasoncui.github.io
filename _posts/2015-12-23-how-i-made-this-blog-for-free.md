*I've had a lot of friends and classmates ask how I made this blog, completely for free. Below I outline some of the steps I took. Hopefully this will serve as a helpful resource to those looking to start a personal site or blog of their own.*

#### What exactly does [HelloToken](http://www.hellotoken.com) do?

Essentially, HelloToken is a product that enables publishers to earn exponentially more per visitor than ads and paywalls through a one-click question that serves as a micropayment. As daily consumers of content, nothing is more distracting and unaesthetic than intrusive advertisements or blurred out paywalls.

HelloToken can replace all obtrusive advertisements on a site with a clean, one-click question that when answered will give immediate access to that page's content. Researchers and companies will pay to ask questions relevant to them - for instance, a startup might be interested in "preference testing" which one of their new logo designs is more appealing. These questions can then be sent off to the proper target audience, whether it be a technology or political blog.

Publishers and bloggers can then use these questions as a form of monetization. By integrating HelloToken into their sites, publishers can be paid for each question answered by visitors to the sites. 

Below is a cool video about HelloToken:

#### What is [HelloToken](http://www.hellotoken.com)'s current strategy and plans for expansion?

As of now HelloToken is based in Boston and working out of Harvard's [i-lab](https://i-lab.harvard.edu/), a great collaborative coworking space. With a little bit of angel funding under its belt, its looking to build up the team in terms of engineers, business development, content and design. 

Around 60 or so publishers have also been signed on, with the focus now being put on researchers and startups who might utilize the product.
