title: How I Made This Blog (For Free!)
comments: True
---

*I've had a lot of people ask me how I made this blog. Completely for free. Below I outline some of the steps I took. Hopefully this will serve as a helpful resource to those looking to start a personal site or blog of their own.* 

As I mention in the [about section]({{ site.url }}/about), this site was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) and is hosted (for free) with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I'll do my best to go through step-by-step the entire process I took. Feel free to leave any questions or comments in the comment section below (which should be working with Disqus integration). 

As to why I chose this method of blogging in particular, I was definitely considering a more user-friendly blogging platform (Wordpress, Squarespace, etc.) but decided to go with Jekyll/Github pages because I didn't want to pay, and wanted the additional customizability. I also liked the minimalistic style of [Poole](http://getpoole.com/). Uploading posts is definitely a tougher process, but hopefully this pans out to be a fun project.

#### Resources

This site wouldn't have been possible without the helpful documentation and walkthroughs available online. Below I list out the resources I used: 

1. [Jekyll Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/). A useful overview of what Jekyll is. Useful tips ranging from content creation to customization.
2. [Poole Homepage](http://getpoole.com/). Poole is the Jekyll theme I use for this site. The homepage contains demos and variations on the main Poole theme you can also use. 
3. [Joshua Lande's Tutorial](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) A great resource from Joshua Lande detailing how to set-up a Jekyll blog with Poole from start to finish. Honestly this source in itself is extensive enough. Also has cool tips about setting up extra features like Google Analytics, comments, etc.
