title: How I Made This Blog (For Free)
comments: True
---

*I've had a lot of people ask me how I made this blog for free. Below I outline some of the steps I took. Hopefully this serves as a helpful resource to those looking to start a personal blog of their own.* 

As I mention in the [about section]({{ site.url }}/about), this site was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) and is hosted (for free) with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I'll do my best to gather all the resources I used to build this site. Feel free to leave any questions or comments in the comment section below (which should be working with Disqus integration). 

As to why I chose this method of blogging in particular, I was definitely considering a more user-friendly blogging platform (Wordpress, Squarespace, etc.) but decided to go with Jekyll/Github pages because I didn't want to pay, and wanted the additional customizability. I also liked the minimalistic style of [Poole](http://getpoole.com/). Uploading posts is definitely a tougher process, but hopefully this pans out to be a fun project.

#### Resources

This site wouldn't have been possible without the helpful documentation and walkthroughs available online. Below are a few of the resources I used: 

1. [Jekyll Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/). A useful overview of what Jekyll is. Useful tips ranging from content creation to customization.
2. [Poole Homepage](http://getpoole.com/). Poole is the Jekyll theme used for this site. The homepage contains demos and variations on the main Poole theme you can also use. 
3. [Joshua Lande's Tutorial](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/). A great resource from Joshua Lande detailing how to set-up a Jekyll blog with Poole from start to finish. **This source in itself is extensive enough.** Also has cool tips about setting up extra features like Google Analytics, comments, etc. 
4. [Vikas Lalwani's Tutorial](http://www.sitepoint.com/set-jekyll-blog-5-minutes-poole/). A similar walkthrough-style post that details how to set-up a Jekyll blog.

#### Jekyll 

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a "static site generator" that runs with Ruby under the hood. It takes content that is formatted in Markdown (a markup language using plain text) and from that generates a static site. [Github Pages](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) uses Jekyll which allows users to host and publish content for free. 

#### Poole 

![Poole]({{ site.url }}/public/poole.png){: .center-image }

As mentioned above, [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) is the Jekyll theme used for this site. Poole also contains two official themes within it called *Hyde* and *Landon* that offer additional features ranging from two-column themes to hidden navigation bars. 

#### URL 

Unfortunately this section will apply only to students. Namecheap for Education offers a free .me domain to students with a .edu address. You can get your free .me domain [here](https://nc.me/). 

With the domain from Namecheap, it is easy to configure Namecheap DNS for Github pages. A good tutorial for that process can be found [here](http://abdelraoof.com/blog/2014/09/20/configuring-namecheap-dns-for-github/).

#### Conclusion 

Be sure to read through all the resources before setting up a site - many of the links guide you through the entire process quite well. In the future I'd love to figure out how to tag posts and then sort by category. Thanks for reading!
