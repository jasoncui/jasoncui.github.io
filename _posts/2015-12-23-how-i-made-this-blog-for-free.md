title: How I Made This Blog (For Free!)
comments: True
---

*I've had a lot of people ask me how I made this blog. Completely for free. Below I outline some of the steps I took. Hopefully this will serve as a helpful resource to those looking to start a personal site or blog of their own.* 

As I mention in the [about section]({{ site.url }}/about), this site was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) and is hosted (for free) with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I'll do my best to go through step-by-step the entire process I took. Feel free to leave any questions or comments in the comment section below (which should be working with Disqus integration). 

As to why I chose this method of blogging in particular, I was definitely considering a more user-friendly blogging platform (Wordpress, Squarespace, etc.) but decided to go with Jekyll/Github pages because I didn't want to pay, and wanted the additional customizability. I also liked the minimalistic style of [Poole](http://getpoole.com/).
