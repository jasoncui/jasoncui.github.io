[Why Startup Hubs Work](http://paulgraham.com/hubs.html)

> The problem is not that most towns kill startups. It's that death is the default for startups, and most towns don't save them. Instead of thinking of most places as being sprayed with startupicide, it's more accurate to think of startups as all being poisoned, and a few places being sprayed with the antidote.

* Environment, Chance, Numbers
* In a hub, people are interesting in what you are doing and running a startup doesn't seem out of the ordinary 
* Chance meetings encourage you to meet people that are able to help you
* Collaborative ecosystem
* Need a certain density of people to encourage meetings
* Sense of optimism, perhaps coming from young people
