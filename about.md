Hi, I'm Jason!

Born and raised in the DMV (DC/Maryland/Virginia area), I'm currently a junior at Harvard studying computer science. I'm passionate about product and the ability technology has to revolutionize our lives.

This site is a collection of my projects, thoughts, and materials I find interesting. Feel free to reach out through my social media handles below.
