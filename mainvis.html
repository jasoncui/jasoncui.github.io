                        Wardell Stephen "Steph" Curry II (born March 14, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Many basketball players have called him the <span id="yellow-highlight">greatest shooter in NBA          history</span>. In 2015, Curry won the <span id="yellow-highlight">NBA Most Valuable Player Award</span> and led the Warriors to their first championship since 1975. In 2016, he led his team to the <span id="yellow-highlight">most wins in an NBA season</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-faded">
                        Curry is the son of former NBA player Dell and older brother of current NBA player Seth. He played college basketball for Davidson. There, he was twice named Southern Conference Player of the Year and set the all-time scoring record for both Davidson and the Southern Conference. During his sophomore year, he also set the single-season NCAA record for three-pointers made.

He is something special."</span> In his first collegiate game, against Eastern Michigan, Curry finished with 15 points but committed 13 turnovers. In the next game, against Michigan, he scored 32 points, dished out 4 assists, and grabbed 9 rebounds. Curry finished the season leading the Southern Conference in scoring with 21.5 points per game. He was second in the nation among freshmen in scoring, behind only Kevin Durant of Texas. Curry's scoring ability helped the Wildcats to a 29–5 overall record and a Southern Conference regular season title. On March 2, 2007, in the Southern Conference tournament semi-finals against Furman, Curry made his 113th three-pointer of the year, breaking Keydren Clark's NCAA freshman season record for 3-point field goals.</p>

                            In his sophomore season in 2007–08, Curry had grown to his adult height of 6 ft. 3 in. and again led the Southern Conference in scoring, averaging 25.5 points per game while adding 4.7 rebounds per game and 2.8 assists per game. He led the Wildcats to a 26–6 regular season record, and a 20–0 conference record. As a result, Davidson earned its third straight NCAA Tournament bid. <br><br> On March 21, 2008, Davidson matched up with seventh-seeded Gonzaga. Gonzaga led by 11 points early in the second half but Curry went on to score 30 points in the half to push Davidson to their first NCAA Tournament win since 1969, 82–76. Curry ended the game with 40 points while also going 8-for-10 from 3-point range. On March 23, Davidson played second seeded Georgetown in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Georgetown, ranked eighth nationally, entered the game as a heavy favorite after an appearance in the Final Four in 2007. Curry managed just five points in the first half of the game as Davidson trailed by as many as 17 points, but his 25 second-half points led Davidson to a 74–70 comeback victory.

Curry joined Clyde Lovellette, Jerry Chambers, and Glenn Robinson as the only college players to score over 30 points in their first four career NCAA tournament games. Curry also tied Darrin Fitzgerald of Butler for the single-season record for most three-pointers with 158. On March 30, 2008, he set the record, against the top-seeded Kansas Jayhawks, with his 159th three-pointer of the season.

                    After Davidson's loss in the NCAA Regional Finals against Kansas, Curry announced that he would return for his junior year. Curry stated he wanted to develop as a point guard as that would be his most likely position in the NBA. On November 18, 2008, <span id="yellow-highlight">Curry scored a career-high 44 points</span> in Davidson's 82–78 loss to Oklahoma. He extended a career-long streak by scoring at least 25 points for the seventh straight game. On November 21, Curry registered a career-high 13 assists, to go along with 30 points, in Davidson's 97–70 win over Winthrop. On November 25, against Loyola, he was held scoreless as Loyola constantly double-teamed Curry. It was Curry's only scoreless collegiate game and just his second without double-digit points. He finished 0-for-3 from the field as Davidson won the game 78-48. In Davidson's next game (11 days later), Curry matched his career-high of 44 in a 72–67 win over North Carolina State.
                    <br><br>
                    Curry surpassed the 2000-point mark for his career on January 3, 2009, as he scored 21 points against Samford. On February 14, 2009, Curry rolled his ankle in the second half of a win over Furman. The injury caused Curry to miss the February 18 game against The Citadel, the first and only game he missed in his college career. On February 28, 2009, Curry became Davidson's all-time leading scorer with 34 points in a 99–56 win against Georgia Southern. That gave Curry 2,488 points for his career, surpassing previous school leader John Gerdy. Davidson won the 2008-09 Southern Conference regular season championship for the south division, finishing 18-2 in the conference.
                    <br><br>
                    In the 2009 Southern Conference Tournament, Davidson played Appalachian State in the quarterfinals and won 84-68. Curry scored 43 points, which is the third most points in Southern Conference tournament history. In the semifinals, against the College of Charleston, Curry had 20 points but Davidson lost 52-59. Despite lobbying from Davidson head coach Bob McKillop and Charleston coach Bobby Cremins, the Wildcats failed to get an NCAA tournament bid. Instead, they received the sixth seed in the 2009 NIT. Davidson played the third seed, South Carolina, on the road in the first round. Curry scored 32 points as the Wildcats beat the Gamecocks 70-63. Davidson would then fall 68-80 to the Saint Mary's Gaels in the second round. Curry registered 26 points, 9 rebounds, and 5 assists in what was his final game for the Wildcats.

                    <p class="text-secondary">
                        Curry was selected with the <span id="yellow-highlight">seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors</span>. His rookie contract was worth $12.7 million over four years. In his first career game, he scored 14 points and distributed 7 assists. With final season averages of 17.5 points, 5.9 assists, and 1.9 steals per game, he finished second in NBA Rookie of the Year voting to Tyreke Evans, and was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.

                    <p class="text-secondary">
                        Upon being drafted in 2009, Curry has played multiple seasons with the Warriors since. 2011-12 was an injury-riddled year for Curry, where he had surgery on his right ankle to repair torn ligaments (which eventually would be resprained). However in the 2012-14 seasons Curry bounced back — he and teammate Klay Thompson gained the nickname <span id="yellow-highlight">“The Splash Brothers”</span> for their phenomenal perimeter scoring. Curry set a career-high 54 points in a game against the Knicks, and set a new league record for three-pointers in a single season. In the 2014-15 season, Curry was voted MVP, Golden State won the NBA championships for the first time in 40 years, and Curry broke the record for most three-pointers made in a postseason.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-secondary">Curry has continued his reign of greatness in the 2015-16 season, becoming the first player to make over 400 three-pointers in a season and helping Golden State achieve the best season record in NBA history. Many aspects of Curry’s game deserves recognition, but it is without a doubt his shooting that is the most phenomenal. <br><br> <span id="yellow-highlight">Here we’ll take a closer look at Curry’s shooting statistics and attempt to break them down.</span>

                            This 2015-2016 season, Stephen was the first ever to hit over <span id="yellow-highlight">400 threes </span>in a season against the Memphis Grizzlies before anyone could hit 300. Stephen Curry's shooting percentage is far higher than the average NBA player. In many articles and statistical analyses of Stephen Curry's shooting performance, it has been shown that Curry is slightly more accurate on the left side of the court, but shoots frequently on both sides. As evident in this shot chart, Stephen Curry is also well known for three-point sideline fadeaways.

                        <p>
                            Furthermore,  Curry averaged five three-pointers per game on <span id="yellow-highlight">45-percent shooting </span>this season to set his historic mark, according to the summary from the NBA statistics site. Although it is hard to see from the actual statistical evidence, which shows the distance he starts jumping from, Curry's shots are actually even harder than they appear to be, as he retreats back from the three-point line to 28 or 30 feet from the basket.

                    Many basketball players have deemed Curry as the greatest shooter in NBA history, and for good reason. Curry is currently the league leader for multiple shooting statistics and has broken numerous shooting records held in the NBA. Curry plays almost exclusively at the point guard position and has career averages of <span id="yellow-highlight">22.4 points, 6.9 assists, and 1.8 steals per game</span>. Using an unorthodox jump shot, he is able to get the ball out of his hands in under half a second by releasing it on the way up, adding extra arc to his shot and making it difficult to block. In addition to his quick release, he puts extra pressure on defenses with his long range, leading the NBA in field goals made from beyond 28 feet in 2016. In an article for FiveThirtyEight, Benjamin Morris emphasized Curry's importance in the NBA's increasing use of the three-point shot, writing, <span id="yellow-highlight">Curry is perhaps the figurehead in the NBA's Three-Point Revolution."</span>

                    Evidently Curry is a phenomal three-point shooter -- being the league leader in multiple aspects. It is then interesting to break down all of Curry's three-pointers per game, per season. The following graph below takes a look at all of Curry's regular NBA seasons -- from 2009 to 2016 -- and tallies the total number of three-pointers scored per game. A typical NBA season will contain around 82 games with minor fluctuationts. Curry sat out more in some seasons than others for a multitude of reasons (injuries, benched in leading games to rotate in other players, etc.) which is reflected in the data.
                    <br><br>
                    Each color represents one of Curry's individual seasons, as outlined in the legend in the top right corner. The graph is structured to show the number of three-pointers scored per game in each season. Hovering over the graph will bring up a tooltip showing the three-pointers scored in that specific game for each season. Clicking on a specific season in the legend will remove that dataset from the graph and the graph will repopulate. Clicking on different graph representations in the top left corner will toggle between the different representations.

                        Curry is not only a phenomenal shooter in terms of three-pointers made, but also field goals within the arc. In the 2015-16 regular season, Curry led the league in number of field goals made, netting <span id="yellow-highlight">805</span>, a decent margin above second place Lebron James.
                        <br><br>
                        Proving himself to be a very versatile shooter, Curry adopts the same style of quick release for all field goals. Curry will often release shots off of one foot after a quick combination move, or fadeaway with a similar quick release. While Curry does hold the record, he is also one of the most prolific shooters in terms of number of attempts. Still, his shooting percentage remains high.
